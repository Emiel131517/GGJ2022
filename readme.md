GGJ2022 Life & Death
===

In 2022 i have participated with four friends to create a 2d platformer game in unity with the theme `duality`

The name of our game is `Life & Death`. Its a 2d platformer game in wich you need to get from start to finish.

In the game you have two worlds, the `life` world and the `death` world. The worlds are mostly the same, but enemies are diffrent and sometimes the other world has a way trough a blockade.

It was very fun working on this project but it was also pretty hard, as this game is made in 42 hours.
